# IBM-CIC hiring test

This git repo contains several hiring tests for potential candidates to show their skills.

## General requirements
* A participant has 24 hours to get as far as possible with a project - you don't have to spend 24 hours.
* A project should be created in git, the platform is not important as long as reviewers can be invited to it
* The participants role should be clearly visible in this git, the readme would be a good place 
* Documentation is not a requirement, but the project should be easy to compile and run 
* It is a plus if an instance of the project should be running in some kind of online environment
* The project should be able to be build from instructions given by the participant
* A justification of technology should be included, why did you choose that language or framework, what strengths does it have, why is it a good fit for the project. If you do not know more than that language that is okay, focus on the frameworks you chose instead.

## Frontend, backend or full-stack
When doing an assignment you choose what to focus on. If your strongest skill is frontend then choose a project that fits your abilities and focus on creating the frontend. If you skills are purely frontend a backend is not required, but mock data should still be in the interface. Same goes for backend but with the API
### Frontend
Focus on creativity, inginuity and speed. How awesome can you make a frontend in the given time and how much of it can you make, make sure there is data and every functionality you include is functional.

### Backend
Focus on a well crafted API, easy to read code and good api documentation. 

### Full-stack
Focus on... everything! show us what you got, you are not expected to get as far as if you were only focusing on the frontend or backend, but here you have a chance to show you know some architecture and system design.

## Deliver on Git
All projects are expetected to be delivered on some sort of git platform, the repository should be open so any and all reviewers can download your source code and see your code. You should send the gir repository link to the hiring manager or a preassigned reviewer

## Have fun with this, be creative and most of all show us that you are a modern developer.

Coding and developing software is so much more than just following best practise. Show us what you got, show us your quirky hacks and ways to tame beta frameworks that others have not thought of, show us a combination of technologies we might not have seen before. This test is made for you, not for us. We want you to show us how you work - best practise will come with time, we need to see your passion and the way you interact with a project 

## Projects
You can read through each project and then select the one that suits you the best, do as many tasks as possible or as few that are perfect as possible - it's up to you. Each project can be made as a frontend, backend or fullstack developer. It is up to you to show us what you can make on these projects.
Each project has a set of tasks and you are *not* expected to be able to get through all of them.
Select a project, read the descriptionm  create a git and get started - we can't wait to work with you!
