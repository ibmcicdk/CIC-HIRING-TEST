## Description
------
One day, you and your team get contacted by a customer service department in a hardware store (Bewhaos A/S). They want a chatbot for managing all customer inquries through their website.
The customer service bot should either be able to be imported into the website, or work as a seperate site which customers can access/get redirected to so forth they have any questions.
You decide how the bot should answer questions and where it should get it's data from. Frameworks are acceptable and encouraged.
## Tasks
all tasks are described as “user stories” - simply put a user wants to be able to do this, you come up with how they are going to do it. **You’re not meant to do all stories but as many as you can and in no particular order.**
### Directions
It is fine to hard code the questions accepted by the chatbot and relevant
### Conversation
- Bewhaos wants the bot to be able to greet the customer upon starting the application and respond with simple politeness gestures as well as respond to goodbye.
- A customer would like an easy to way to find out what the chatbot can do and how it can help him
- A customer enquires about available hammer products . Asking the chatbot, the bot returns a list of links to an assortment of hammers of different brands.
- A customer enquires about available screwdriver products. Asking the chatbot, the bot replies that no screwdrivers are in stock.
- Bewhaos would like to handle media with their chatbot. They want to be able to send images and videos through the chatbot.
- [Feel free to come up with other interesting or elaborate concversation scenarios]
### Configuration dashboard
- A customer service rep wants to inform the bot about new product lines, and enters a configuration dashboard, where he can publish a link for the new product line making it available for the bot to crawl.
- A customer asks a question for which the chatbot does not know the answer. The bot reports this to the configuration dashboard and creates a notification for the customer service team.
- A customer service rep logs in to the configuration dashboard to see new notifications from the chatbot. The customer service rep. finds a question about garden furniture which the chatbot has made a report on, and fixes the error by grouping the input request with other garden furniture questions.
### Nearest store lookup
- A customer wants to visit the store, but is unsure about the weather - he wants to ask the bot about the weather (BACKEND)
- A customer wants to know where the nearest store is
- A customer wants displayed by the bot where the nearest store is (FRONTEND)
